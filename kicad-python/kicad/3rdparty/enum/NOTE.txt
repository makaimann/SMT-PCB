This is the `enum34` python module from
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34 . Normally you should download and
install this using `pip` command:

    pip install enum34

Unfortunately at the moment KiCad's windows edition (which comes with
its own python distribution) doesn't come with 'pip' program and it
cannot be installed (*). `kicad-python` will try to import enum module
from here if it cannot import it from the default python libraries.
